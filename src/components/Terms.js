                  <p>
                    3.1. All work carried out by The Company at your request,
                    whether experimental or otherwise will be charged
                    accordingly. Any work undertaken by The Company on behalf of
                    The Client is carried out on the basis that The Client has
                    fully approved such work whether or not we have received an
                    official order providing there is evidence of written or
                    verbal confirmation to proceed, including letter, facsimile
                    or email correspondence between the parties. <br /> 3.2.
                    Payments of fees rendered by invoice are due within the

                    the right to withhold services, documents and information,
                    and have the right to cease to work on your account, and to
                    terminate the engagement if payments are unduly delayed.

                    valid for a period of 20 (Twenty) days, after which time we

                    We provide services on a one-off and retainer basis. <br />

                    9.1. The Company’s public liability insurance will cover
                    damages caused by a cleaning operative working on behalf of
                    the Company up to £1,000,000.00. In order to keep our prices
                    competitive all claims are subject to an excess of £100.00
                    pay able by the client. <br /> 9.2. The Client agrees that
                    due to the nature of the service the Company guarantees only

                    problem occurs on a Saturday it must be reported by Monday
                    12:00 in order to be accepted as a valid claim. Failure to

                    happen. Identical replacement is always attempted but not
                    guaranteed. For this specific reason, the Company requests
                    all irreplaceable items (whether monetarily or sentimentally

                    repair the item at its cost. If the item cannot be repaired
                    the Company will rectify the problem by crediting the
                    customer with the item’s present actual cash value toward a

                    together by the Company and the Insurance Provider(s).
                    Monetary compensation as well as legal fees may incur.{" "}

                    difficult to calculate precisely how long such tasks may
                    take and that a degree of flexibility may be required.
                    Please note that one off cleans may take longer to complete

                    12.5. The Client understands that the price he has been
                    quoted may vary according to condition of property and room
                    sizes etc. <br /> 12.6. The Company shall endeavor to
                    arrange a replacement cleaner if your regular cleaner cannot
                    attend a scheduled visit, and will inform the Client prior
                    to the visit. <br /> 12.7. Post Construction Cleaning
                    (Builders Cleaning), Event Cleaning or badly neglected homes
                    may take up to three times longer than a well maintained
                    home requiring general cleaning. Therefore the Company
                    advises the Client to ask for our specialist cleaning
                    services: Builders Cleaning or Event Cleaning. <br /> 12.8.
                    The cleaning operatives are not allowed to hand wash any
                    items of clothing belonging to the Client. The Company
                    advises that our operatives can only use a washing machine
                    for such tasks. <br /> 12.9. All fragile and highly
                    breakable items must be secured or removed.
                    <br /> 12.10. The Company reserves the right to make
                    reasonable changes to the Terms and Conditions in agreement
                    with the other party.

                  <h1> OUR GUARANTEE</h1>
                  <p>
                    13.1. The Company has built its business and reputation by
                    providing its clients with the best possible cleaning
                    service available. Still, the Company realizes, that because
                    its operatives are human beings, they sometimes make
                    mistakes. For this reason, the Company offers a Guarantee.
                    If the Client is not satisfied with any areas that have been
                    cleaned, the Company’s operative will come back to the
                    Client’s premises and re-clean those areas free of charge.
                  </p>

              </ul>
              <span>
                Please note that this guarantee will not apply if the condition
                of the premises has deteriorated since the original cleaning was
                undertaken.
